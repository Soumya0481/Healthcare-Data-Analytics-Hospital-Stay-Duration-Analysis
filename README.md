🏥 Healthcare Data Analytics: Hospital Stay Duration Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Healthcare Data Analytics study focused on analyzing hospital stay duration using a structured healthcare dataset. The goal is to understand whether demographic, medical, or administrative factors significantly influence the length of hospital stays.

The project demonstrates practical data analytics skills including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and meaningful visualizations using Python.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and validate a large healthcare dataset
Engineer a new feature: Hospital Stay (Days)
Perform exploratory and comparative data analysis
Identify key factors affecting hospital stay duration
Visualize distributions, proportions, and trends
Derive clear, data-driven insights

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python
Pandas – data manipulation and analysis
NumPy – numerical operations
Matplotlib – core visualizations
Seaborn – advanced statistical visualizations
